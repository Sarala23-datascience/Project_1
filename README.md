# House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model. The dataset used is the California Housing Prices dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
    'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the results or use the provided script.

## Results
Here, the price from the actual data and price predicted from the model is compared. The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which shows less the MAE more accurate is the model. 

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple approach to predicting house prices using linear regression.
